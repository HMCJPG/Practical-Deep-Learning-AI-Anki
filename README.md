# Practical-Deep-Learning-Anki-FastAI


Flashcard set intended to be paired as practice questions alongside the Practical Deep Learning for Coders FastAI online video courses -- flashcard decks are split by video lesson as opposed to the chapters, with only questions emphasizing either direct conceptual application or tangible program usage. Includes code snippets from various FastAI Kaggle notebooks, created by Jeremy Howard. Inspired heavily from the FastAI flashcard set made by Nathaniel Demours. Created for use with Shia Lab at Harvey Mudd College by Jason Paul Gounder.
